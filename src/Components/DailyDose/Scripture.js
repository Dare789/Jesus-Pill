     Script:`And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan. {wherein…: Heb. of his father’s 
      sojournings} 2  These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; 
      and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their 
      evil report. 3  Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat 
      of many colours. {colours: or, pieces} 4  And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated 
      him, and could not speak peaceably unto him. 5  And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet 
      the more. 6  And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed: 7  For, behold, we were binding sheaves 
      in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to 
      my sheaf. 8  And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they 
      hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words. 9  And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, 
      Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me. 10  And he told it 
      to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I 
      and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth? 11  And his brethren envied him; but his father 
      observed the saying. 12  And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem. 13  And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy 
      brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I. 14  And he said to him, Go, 
      I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the 
      vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. {see…: Heb. see the peace of thy brethren, etc.} 15  And a certain man found him, and, behold, 
      he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou? 16  And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray 
      thee, where they feed their flocks. 17  And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph 
      went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan. 18  And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired 
      against him to slay him. 19  And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh. {dreamer: Heb. master of dreams} 20  Come now 
      therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what 
      will become of his dreams. 21  And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him. 22  And 
      Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid 
      him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again. 23  And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they 
      stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him; {colours: or, pieces} 24  And they took him, and cast him into 
      a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it. 25  And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, 
      and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to 
      Egypt. 26  And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood? 27  Come, and let us sell 
      him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content. {were…: 
      Heb. hearkened} 28  Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to 
      the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.`,

      Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day 
      of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt. 2  And the whole congregation
      of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness: 3  And the children 
      of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, 
      when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth
      into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger. 4  Then said the LORD unto Moses,

      every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no. {a certain…: Heb. the portion of a day in his day}
      5  And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much
      as they gather daily. 6  And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD 
      hath brought you out from the land of Egypt: 7  And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth
      your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that ye murmur against us? 8  And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall
      give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye 
      murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD. 9  And Moses spake unto Aaron,

       Script:`Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned 
        to Jerusalem. 14  But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day,
        and sat down. 15  And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and 
        brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on. 16  Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men 
        of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience. 17  The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when 
        they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it. 18  And about the time of forty years 
        suffered he their manners in the wilderness. {suffered…: or bore, or fed them as a nurse beareth, or feedeth, her child} 19  And when 
        he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot. 20  And after that he gave unto them 
        judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet. 21  And afterward they desired a king: and God gave 
        unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years. 22  And when he had removed him, he raised 
        up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine 
        own heart, which shall fulfil all my will. 23  Of this man’s seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, 
        Jesus: 24  When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. 25  And as John 
        fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet 
        I am not worthy to loose. 26  Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the 
        word of this salvation sent.`,

       Script:`Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee; {cast…: or, delivered up} 13  And 
       leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim: 14  
       That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, 15  The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, 
       by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles; 16  The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them 
       which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up. 17  From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for 
       the kingdom of heaven is at hand. 18  And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his 
       brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. 19  And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. 
       20  And they straightway left their nets, and followed him. 21  And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of 
       Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them. 22  And they immediately 
       left the ship and their father, and followed him.`,

      Script:`Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, {Jonah: Gr. Jonas} 2  Arise, go to Nineveh, that great 
      city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me. 3  But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the 
      LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them 
      unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.  4  But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the 
      sea, so that the ship was like to be broken. {sent out: Heb. cast forth} {was like…: Heb. thought to be broken} 5  Then the mariners were 
      afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah 
      was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep. 6  So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What 
      meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not. 7  And they said every one 
      to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell 
      upon Jonah. 8  Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and whence 
      comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou? 9  And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of 
      heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land. {the LORD: or, JEHOVAH} 10  Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, 
      Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them. {exceedingly…: Heb. with 
      great fear} 11  Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was 
      tempestuous. {may…: Heb. may be silent from us} {wrought…: or, grew more and more tempestuous: Heb. went} 12  And he said unto them, 
      Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon 
      you. 13  Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against 
      them. {rowed: Heb. digged} {wrought…: or, grew more and more tempestuous: Heb. went} 14  Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, 
      We beseech thee, O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man’s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD,

      should be made of none effect. {words: or, speech} 18  For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but
      unto us which are saved it is the power of God. 19  For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to 
      nothing the understanding of the prudent. 20  Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not 
      God made foolish the wisdom of this world? 21  For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God 
      by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. 22  For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: 23  But 
      we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness; 24  But unto them which are called, both 
      Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. 25  Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness

      noble, are called: 27  But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of
